# Tic Tac Toe

This is a project I made for Free Code Camp. You can play against the computer. Built using React, ES2015 syntax, styled-components for CSS styling, testing with Jest + Enzyme and eslinting setup following the airbnb style guide. I wrote the computer opponent logic myself, and it seems to work, you should be able to tie at best.
